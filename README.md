This chart highlights the **inverse relationship** between **gold prices** and the **USD-INR exchange rate**, especially in macroeconomic pressure years (e.g., 2013, 2020).

## 📌 Maximum Historical Rates (2000–2025)
| Asset           | Max Value |

| Silver (1kg)    | ₹96,000   |
| FD Rate         | 22.31%    |
| USD-INR         | ₹83.47    |

## 🔍 Observations & Insights

### 📈 Return Patterns:
- **Gold** showed steady growth with spikes during economic uncertainty (2009–2013, 2020–2023).
- **Silver** was more volatile but had sharp peaks (e.g., 2011).
- **FDs** delivered consistent but lower returns (~6% average).
- **USD-INR** increase over time reflects INR depreciation, impacting import-driven gold pricing.

### 🔄 USD vs Gold Behavior:
- In many periods, **Gold and USD-INR moved inversely**.
- When **USD gets stronger**, gold prices in INR may **adjust or slow down**.
- This reflects the **import pricing mechanism**, since India imports most of its gold.
